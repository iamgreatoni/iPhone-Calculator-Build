# iPhone Calculator Build


This is a project that focuses on building the exact replica of the iPhone calculator, and it is built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

on going.

Hey, I've completed this project! hurray!! 

I kinda feel like a badass programing wiz, so I will be updating a few more functionality into the calculator to make it work fully and as exactly as an Iphone's calculator should work.
